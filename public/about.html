<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Heyyyy! My name is Sunitha V. I'm a BCA Graduate currently enjoying unemployment (It's 6th august 2023 It's been a year since I completed my BCA still not yet graduated!! #troublesfacedifyouareaffiliatedtobangaloreuniversitycolleges)</p>

<p>
I'm learning this skill of Full stack web development for the second time (actually for the nth time). This time I'm dedicated to finish this Course.
I had already completed 80% but burned out so starting it again after like half a year. Goshhhh! (Ughhh am I Journaling or what). Yeah so I don't have anything to write about me so I'm just writing what's on my mind.
</p>

<p>I reallllyyy need to master this skill cause I feel like if I do this then I can pursue something that I really want to do.. I'm not so invested in all these tech thingy(maybe a little cause I've been in Computer Science field for like 5 years now, and I don't know what I've learned in my college... Seriously?
  These colleges are just to make money!!! They don't even teach you skills.. Ughh I'm So Frustratedddddd) To whoever reading this.. are you thaaaaat interested in my life?? Like bruh If you work in this field help me get an internshippppp the only ship I want for noww XD HAHAHAHA I'm soo Funnyyyyyy!! (By the way if you want to contact me you can go to the contact me page and mail me..)
